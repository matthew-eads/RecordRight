	<div id = "Paragraph">
	Azmina was born in the United Arab Emirates, in a large city called Abu Dhabi. From there, she moved to the United States when she was five, to the town Norwood in Massachusetts. From there, she moved around, staying in Massachusetts, until she ended up in Franklin MA. During 7th grade, she made the decision to go to India, to her parents' home-state Kerala to learn more about her culture and language. She stayed in Kerala for two years, in which time she grew fluent in her mother tongue, Malayalam. When she returned to the United States, she went to high school at the Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School. Here, she grew fascinated by both medical technologies and computer science. She was accepted to Tufts University with a goal: to make robotic surgery a reasonable possibility in normal hospitals. After joining Tufts, Azmina has become a part of a body-positive dance troupe and an internationally competing slam poetry team that focuses on the experience of being a woman of color. She continues to work towards her goal of robotic surgery through her classes and major, and hopes to go to medical school after she graduates from Tufts.
